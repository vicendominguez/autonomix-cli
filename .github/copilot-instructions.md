# Copilot Instructions for Autonomix CLI 

## Project Overview

Autonomix CLI is a Go-based application manager that installs and tracks applications from GitHub releases. It supports multiple installation methods: system packages (.deb, .rpm, .flatpak, .snap, .appimage, Arch packages), Homebrew (macOS), and direct binary installation. Provides both CLI and TUI interfaces.

## Build and Test

**Build:**
```bash
go build
```

**Run locally:**
```bash
go run main.go
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
go test ./...
```

**Run specific test:**
```bash
go test -run TestName ./pkg/installer
```

**Release build:**
Uses GoReleaser - see `.goreleaser.yaml` for configuration. Builds for Linux (amd64/arm64) and generates .deb, .rpm, and Arch packages.

## Architecture

### Core Flow
1. **main.go**: Entry point. Handles CLI args for adding repos (`autonomix-cli add <url>` or just `autonomix-cli <url>`). Ensures the app tracks itself at `SelfRepoURL`.
2. **config/**: Manages `~/.autonomix/config.json` persistence. Stores list of tracked apps with their repo URLs, versions, and latest release info.
3. **pkg/manager**: Orchestrates adding apps - cleans GitHub URLs, fetches releases, detects system-installed versions via `pkg/system`.
4. **pkg/github**: API client for fetching GitHub releases and assets.
5. **pkg/system**: Queries system package managers (dpkg, rpm, pacman, flatpak, snap) to detect installed versions.
6. **pkg/packages**: Detects package type from asset filename (deb, rpm, flatpak, etc.).
7. **pkg/installer**: Filters compatible assets based on OS/architecture and package type, handles installation commands.
8. **tui/model.go**: Bubble Tea TUI with three states: `viewList` (main list), `viewAdd` (text input for URL), `viewSelectAsset` (choose which asset to install).

### Key Data Flow
- User adds repo → `manager.AddApp()` → GitHub API → detect system version → save to config → refresh TUI
- User presses 'u' on item → fetch latest release → compare versions → prompt to install if update available
- Version comparison uses `normalizeVersion()` to strip "v" prefixes and package revision suffixes (e.g., "-1")

## Conventions

**Self-tracking**: The app always tracks itself via `SelfRepoURL` constant (defined in both `main.go` and `tui/model.go`). On startup, it adds itself if missing and updates its version from the `version` variable (set by GoReleaser).

**URL normalization**: GitHub URLs are cleaned to base repo format (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) - strips `/releases`, trailing slashes, etc.

**Version normalization**: The `normalizeVersion()` function removes:
- "v" prefix (v1.0.0 → 1.0.0)
- Debian revision suffix (1.0.0-1 → 1.0.0)
- RPM dist tags (1.0.0-1.el9 → 1.0.0)

This ensures accurate version comparisons between GitHub releases and system-installed packages.

**TUI keybindings**:
- Start typing → add new repo
- Enter → confirm
- u → check/install updates
- d → delete (stop tracking)
- q/Ctrl+C → quit

**State management**: TUI uses three states (`viewList`, `viewAdd`, `viewSelectAsset`). Always return to `viewList` after operations. The list is rebuilt on state transitions to reflect config changes.

**Error handling**: Operations (add, update, delete) show status messages via `model.statusMessage` and `model.statusTime`. Messages auto-clear after 3 seconds.
